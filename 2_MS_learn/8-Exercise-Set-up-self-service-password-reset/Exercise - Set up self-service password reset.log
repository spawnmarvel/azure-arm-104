Exercise - Set up self-service password reset

Create an Azure AD organization
* The default Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization in the Azure sandbox doesn't support SSPR. So in this exercise, let's create a second organization and switch to it.
* Sign in to the Azure portal with the same account you used to activate the sandbox.
* Select Create a resource > Identity > Azure Active Directory.

We have it.

Create an Azure AD Premium P2 trial subscription
* Now activate a trial Premium subscription for the organization so that you can test SSPR.
* Go to Azure Active Directory > Password reset.
* Select Get a free Premium trial to use this feature.
* Under AZURE AD PREMIUM P2, expand Free trial and then select Activate.
* Refresh the browser to see the Password reset - Properties page.

Nope...not Now

Create a group
* You want to roll out SSPR to a limited set of users first to make sure your SSPR configuration works as expected.
  Let's begin by creating a security group for the limited rollout.

Group name	SSPRTesters

Create a user account

Enable SSPR
* In your Azure AD organization, under Manage, select Password reset.
* If the password reset page still displays the message Get a free Premium trial to use this feature, wait for a few minutes and then refresh the page.
* On the Properties page, select Selected. Select the SSPRTesters group, and then select Save.

Register for SSPR
* Now that the SSPR configuration is complete, register a mobile phone number for the user you created.
* In a new browser window, go to https://aka.ms/ssprsetup.
* Sign in with the user name balas@organization-domain-name.onmicrosoft.com and the password that you noted earlier.
* If you're asked to update your password, enter a new password of your choice. Make sure you note the new password.
* Next to Authentication phone is not configured, select Set it up now.
* Enter your mobile phone details.
* Select text me.
* When you receive the code on your mobile phone, enter the code in the text box.
* Select verify, and then select finish.
* Complete the captcha, and then select Next.
* Enter your mobile phone number, and then select Text.
* When the text arrives, in the Enter your verification code text box, enter the code you were sent. Select Next.
* Enter a new password, and then select Finish. Make sure you note the new password.
* Sign out of the account.
