Exercise - Grant access using Azure RBAC and the Azure portal

A co-worker named Alain at First Up Consultants needs permission to create and manage virtual machines 
for a project he is working on. Your manager has asked that you handle this request. 
Using the best practice to grant users the least privileges to get their work done,
