What is Azure Active Directory?
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity and access management service, 
which helps your employees sign in and access resources in:
* External resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications.
* Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization. 
  For more information about creating a tenant for your organization, see Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory.

Azure Active Directory Free. Provides user and group management, on-premises directory synchronization, 
basic reports, self-service password change for cloud users, and single sign-on across Azure, Microsoft 365, and many popular SaaS apps.

Azure Active Directory Premium P1. In addition to the Free features, P1 also lets your hybrid users access both on-premises and cloud resources. 
It also supports advanced administration, such as dynamic groups, self-service group management, Microsoft Identity Manager (an on-premises identity and access management suite) 
and cloud write-back capabilities, which allow self-service password reset for your on-premises users.

Azure Active Directory Premium P2. In addition to the Free and P1 features, 
P2 also offers Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to help provide risk-based Conditional Access to your apps and critical company data and Privileged Identity Management to help discover, 
restrict, and monitor administrators and their access to resources and to provide just-in-time access when needed.
