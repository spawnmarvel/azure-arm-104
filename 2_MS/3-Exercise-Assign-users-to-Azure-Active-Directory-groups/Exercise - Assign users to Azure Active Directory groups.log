Exercise - Assign users to Azure Active Directory groups

In this exercise, you'll create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group to manage the developer team's access. 
You'll also add a rule for the group to manage the membership automatically.


Add a new group

Groups | All groups
Default Directory - Azure Active Directory->group->new

Setting	             Value
Group type	         Security
Group name	         Developer group
Group description	 Developer team

Use direct assignment to add a user to this group

Developer group | Members
Group
Chris Green is now a member.


Modify the group to use dynamic assignment
* You can change the group to use dynamic assignment. Membership then depends on whether a user meets the rules you set for the group.

NOTE: If you didn't activate the free trial for Azure AD Premium 2, you won't be able to complete this section. 
    That's ok. You can still see how you change the group to use dynamic assignment.

Developer group | Properties
Group
Change Membership type to Dynamic User.
-> Under Dynamic user members, select the Add dynamic query link.

On the Configure Rules tab, select the following values for the rule:

Setting	         Value
Property	     country
Operator	     Equals
Value	         United States

save->
The membership of this group now depends on whether the user is in the United States.

Change group back to assigned
Change Membership type to Assigned. ->save
