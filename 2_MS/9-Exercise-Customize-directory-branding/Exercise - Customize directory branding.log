Exercise - Customize directory branding

Suppose you've been asked to display your retail organization's branding 
on the Azure sign-in page to reassure users that they're passing credentials to a legitimate system.

To complete this exercise, you must have two image files:
* A page background image. This must be a PNG or JPG file, 1920 x 1080 pixels, and smaller than 300 KB.
* A company logo image. This must be a PNG or JPG file, 280 x 60 pixels, and smaller than 10 KB.

Customize Azure AD organization branding
Let's use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to set up the custom branding.

Sign in to the Azure portal with the same account you used to activate the sandbox.

Go to your Azure AD organization by selecting Azure Active Directory. If you're not in the right Azure AD organization, go to your Azure profile in the upper-right corner and select Switch directory to find your organization.

Under Manage, select Company branding > Configure.

Next to Sign-in page background image, select Browse. Select your page background image.

Next to Banner logo, select Browse. Select your logo image.

Test the organization's branding
Now, let's use the account that we created in the last exercise to test the branding.

In a new browser window, go to https://login.microsoft.com.

Select the account for Bala Sandhu. Your custom branding is displayed.
