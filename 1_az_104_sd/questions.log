Manage RBAC
1
Company has:
Subscription and tenant, and want to ensure that only particular SKU for VM can be launched on account.
The implement RBAC, role based access to do the job, is this enough?
*
No, must apply policy....
Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what areas they have access to.
2
Company has:
Subscription and tenant and virtual net named mysoftware-network with:
User1, owner
User2, security admin
user3, network contributor
Who would be able to add subnet to the vnet?
*
User1 and 3
If you look at the Network Contributor Role, they have access to manage Virtual Networks. And then by default the Owner will have all privileges over Azure resources.
3
Company has:
Subscription and tenant and virtual net named mysoftware-network.
a dev group mysoftware-dev in tenant, this group will AD users with developer role to manage logic apps.
You add logic app contributor to group, is this enough?
*
Yes, 
If you look at the permissions for the in-built roles for Logic Apps, you can see that the role has the permissions for managing Logic App resources

4
Subscription:
1
Company has:
account and subscription, how to ensure that only IT admin can make vm's?
*
Azure policy and assign it to the subscription.
Azure policies are used for governance purposes.

Storage accounts are access by keys. Using SAS will let them have very granular access without exposing any other part of your storage account.
2
2 pb (much data), not many use it. If you do not fill it up, what would be the likey reason to create more then 1 unmanged storage account?
*
Exceeding the max 20 k IO operations a second.
The main reason for creating separate storage accounts is when you are having a lot of IO operations per second.
3
Company need:
storage account name named whatever-arc
key req:
store virtual disk files for vm's
cost must be minimized
replication cost also minimized
*
LRS, locally redundant storage
Since replication costs need to be minimized, you can choose the Locally redundant storage replication option. 
LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options.  (MS)
LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures.

CDN and Files
1
Requested to move some docs to azure, size 500 mb.
Requirements:
move to blob storage
copy over internet to azure
*
Azure storage explorer to cp the Files

*
reduce traffic to webserves for staic, unchanged files (images, video, pdf's)
Content Delivery Network - allows you to improve performance by removing the burden of serving static, 
unchanging files from the main server to a network of servers around the globe; 
a CDN can reduce traffic to a server by 50% or more, which means you can serve more users or serve the same users faster

3
CDN is used to accelarate static files (img, vid, pdf, scripts), but if website is custom to each user (personal content +++)
How can CDN help dynamic websites server data faster?

CDN can read the HTML as it passes through and automatically fetch the next files to be delivered without the client needing to ask.

users for all world must have same performance when access website
You deploy Azure File sync,doed this meet Requirements?
*

need rule for bck, daily at 12 and stored for 45 days.

MS docs say-> all schedule information in the backup policy
3
Primary goal of cloud bck servcie is:
*
Prevent data loss, by bck for vm and other rg's that has/stores data
