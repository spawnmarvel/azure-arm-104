Section 5: Manage Azure AD objects
Users and groups, add roles in Azure active directory, many built in.
Add company user or invite guest user or register device.

Section 6: Manage role-based access control (RBAC)
When you have user or group, you can restricted the access on vm, vnet, rg with access control (IAM) on the blade for the vm, vnet or rg.
Add role assignment to user, group or service principal.

* Rule, give the least permission.

We can create custom role (AD) also, if the built in is not enough, for example on the rg.
IAM->Create a custom role
Add permissions
Exclude permissions

Lab:
Add users and groups, give them access to different resources, test it in the portal.

Section 8: Create and configure storage accounts

Fundamental of the cloud, place to store files in azure.
1 Container storage for files, blobs.
2 Managed storage backend for VM's (C,D, HD etc)

Create storage account:
Basic:
Performance
Standard, most scenarios.
Premium, (SSD, but more cost) for low latency.
Redundancy:
GRS, Geo-redundancy storage, in region and a copy of files in secondary region. 6 Copies
LRS, 1 file in region, 2 copy of files in same region. 3 Copies. Low cost
ZRS, similar LRS, but separate datacenters power, water etc. That is zones.
GZRS, combines GRS and ZRS.

Advanced:
Security, https.
Encrypted, they are by default, but can encrypt at rest.
Public acces, ACL, No public access (then use IAM or RBAC)
Enable key access
TLS, keep
Data lake gen2, big data.
Blob, table, queue and azure files.
NFS, network file share (mount, T or F drive for example)
Access tier:
Hot,
Cool,
Cannot set archive default, but move after.
Large files, 100 TB.
Tables and Queue (FIFO), control the security key's for that.

Networking:
Public endpoint (is is secure, but have to protect the key's
Public selected networks
Private.
Routing
Example account in Canada, Client in Japan.
MS,Travel through MS global network as long as possible (small charge)
Internet, the pops out of account as close as possible to st account then public internet to Japan. (no charge)

Data protection
Recovery, straight forward, keep for x days etc.
Tracking and version and notification on change.

Tags, review and create.

Access keys and SAS (for third parties)

A quick look at the storage account:
properties tab: features
monitoring, egress (leaving from azure) ingress (in to azure)
capabilities: upgrade and more, static website, data protection, lifecycle,
CDN, custom domain etc
advisor:
tutorials:
developer coder:

Can access it through access key, 2 keys, for security and deploy key and not break apps or other.
key1, keep it secure!! If it exposed we muste generate a new key and use the other in the mean time.

Shared access signature SAS (a URI, HTTP/HTTPS), delegate access to application or individuals without giving key.
for example just read on a , just access to a file, date limit, filter by ip and so on.
Then we sign with key1 and generate a SAS and connection string.

If you generate a new key 1 or 2, then the SAS that used that key must also be generated again.

Storage explorer:
The best way to interact is if you download storage explorer or programmatic ways, API's or SDK.
Log analytics
Redundant storage
Copy files with AzCopy
