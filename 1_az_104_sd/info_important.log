Section 13 Windows and Linux VMs (25)*

Modifying existing ARM templates Part 1:
ARM (opposite model not used ASM)
When we create vm we can look at template and paramters file.
Can download the both files and download script to deploy the template (the spesific onw) for ps1, ruby and .net and cli.

Template:

* JSON
* Schema URL
* ContentVersion for you to increment
* Parameters file
* Varables similar to parameters, but are compute fields, aka rg function, name of rg, and createting a vnet of that.
* They are constructed

* Output
The key section is the resource section

Parameters:
* 1 param for each param defined in the template
* Template location para , a string-> paramters file has the string parameter "West Europe" for example
